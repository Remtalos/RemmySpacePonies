# RemmySpacePonies
An iteration upon veon's KerbalSpacePonies mod with custom OCs

HOW TO INSTALL:

This mod is most easily installed using CKAN (Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network), which is THE go-to mod launcher for Kerbal Space Program.
Make sure you got your KSP install ready and that you got CKAN ready too.
Seeing as I do not currently add much of value over veon, aside from a couple OCs from my pals, I have chosen not to integrate into CKANs main official repository.
You will have to do a little configuration to get it to show up:

Once you open CKAN, go to CKAN settings and look for the metadata repository settings.
Here you can add an entry (Name/URL Pair) for my CKAN repo.
It should look something like this:

Name       |  URL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RemmyMods  |  https://github.com/Remtalos/RemmySpacePoniesCKAN/archive/main.tar.gz

This ensures that CKAN will check my repo for the various versions of the mod hosted here.
After adding this entry, go to the main CKAN interface and let it update the available mod list.
You should now find "Remmy's Space Ponies" and be able to use it like any other mod!

Keep in mind, running both this and veons Kerbal Space Ponies does not make any sense whatsoever.
I therefore configured them to be "incompatible".

Thanks for checking this out.
Have fun flying ponies to space!
